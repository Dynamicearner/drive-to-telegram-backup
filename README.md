- üìä Progress tracking for downloads and uploads

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google Cloud Platform account
- Telegram account with API access
- A Telegram channel where you want to upload files

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dynamicearner/drive-to-telegram-backup/
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Google Drive Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Drive API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Drive API"
   - Click "Enable"

4. Create a Service Account:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
   - Fill in the service account details
   - Click "Create and Continue"
   - Skip the optional steps and click "Done"

5. Generate Service Account Key:
   - Click on the created service account
   - Go to "Keys" tab
   - Click "Add Key" > "Create new key"
   - Choose "JSON" format
   - Download the JSON file
   - Rename it to `service_account.json` and place it in the project root

6. Share Google Drive folders with the service account:
   - Open the downloaded JSON file
   - Copy the `client_email` value
   - Share your Google Drive folders with this email address
   - Give "Viewer" permissions

### 4. Telegram Setup

1. Get your Telegram API credentials:
   - Go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/)
   - Log in with your phone number
   - Go to "API development tools"
   - Create a new application
   - Note down your `api_id` and `api_hash`

2. Get your Channel ID:
   - Add your user account to the channel as an admin
   - Forward a message from the channel to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
   - The channel ID will be shown (it starts with -100)

**Note:** This script uses Telegram MTProto library for user account login, not a bot. You'll need to authenticate with your personal Telegram account.

### 5. Environment Configuration

1. Create your `.env` file (`.env.local` is just an example):

```bash
cp .env.local .env
```

2. Edit `.env` with your actual values:

```env
# Telegram Pyrogram User account Configuration
API_ID=your_api_id_here
API_HASH=your_api_hash_here
CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here

# Google Drive Configuration
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=service_account.json

# File Upload Settings
MAX_SIZE=1992294400
```

**Important:** The actual environment file should be named `.env`, not `.env.local`. The `.env.local` file is just an example template.


## Usage

1. Make sure your `service_account.json` file is in the project root
2. Update your `.env` file with correct values
3. Run the Script:

```bash
python3 drive_to_telegram.py
```

The script will:
- Scan your Google Drive (My Drive + Shared with Me)
- Download each file
- Upload to your Telegram channel using your user account
- Split large files automatically
- Clean up temporary files

**Note:** On first run, you'll be prompted to authenticate with your Telegram account using your phone number and verification code.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Service account not found" error:**
   - Make sure `service_account.json` is in the project root
   - Verify the service account has access to your Google Drive

2. **"Channel not found" error:**
   - Check your `CHANNEL_ID` in the `.env` file
   - Make sure your user account is added to the channel as an admin

3. **"API credentials invalid" error:**
   - Verify your `API_ID` and `API_HASH` in the `.env` file
   - Make sure you're using the correct credentials from my.telegram.org

4. **"File too large" error:**
   - The script automatically handles large files by splitting them
   - If you still get this error, check your `MAX_SIZE` setting

5. **"Authentication failed" error:**
   - Make sure you're using your personal Telegram account credentials
   - Check that your phone number and verification code are entered correctly
   - Ensure your account has access to the target channel
